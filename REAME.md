# Influenza-virus-DI-identification-pipeline

# DESCRIPTION

The mechanisms and consequences of defective interfering particle (DIP) formation during influenza A virus infection remain poorly understood.

The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to identify large numbers of DIP-associated sequences.

This tool attempts to extract DIPs from Illumina paired-end gzipped fastq files (i.e. sample_name_R1.fastq.gz, sample_name_R2.fastq.gz).
